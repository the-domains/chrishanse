Hello World. My name is Chris Hanse and this is my first post for my new blog using \#TheGrid.io web development software.

I'm going to keep this post brief so that I can check out all the cool features the grid has to offer. My posts will generally discuss being a stay at home dad that works through the trials and tribulations of balancing work life and my home life. Of course we will cover other favorite topics of mine such as movies/shows, sports/outdoor adventures, philosophy, technology, really there are a lot of fun things to discuss. If you are looking for heated debates on politics you've come to the wrong place. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3c897963-8bdb-4f2c-b873-6fea7ae066e8.jpg)

I'd like to put out a short disclaimer; even though I have my opinion on topics, I am not dead set in my ways of thinking. Just because I may disagree with you on something, it does not mean I won't listen to what you have to say. I try not to draw a line in the sand and say "this is right and that is wrong," and i'd appreciate if my audience keeps the same open mind that I do when you disagree with something that someone on here says. I don't want to be a sheep who surrounds myself with like minded individuals, I want to explore the thought process and ideas of many different people so that I may continue to learn and grow as a person. If this isn't what you are looking for, then now is the time to move on. If you want to discuss interesting topics, follow along. Thanks for stopping by...Chris
